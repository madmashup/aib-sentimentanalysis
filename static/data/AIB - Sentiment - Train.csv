295,"Detailed discussion where the reasons for cyclical and defensive cycles to be affected in different ways by the business cycle, and the corresponding impact on portfolio management, were well presented",neutral,
296,"Yes, and as of March  there's still no consensus in regards to the benefits of quantitative easing programs put forward by a variety of central banks around the world",neutral,
297,"Yes, true indeed It's the least observable of the parameters What's the reason for the volatility of the underlying to affect the price of the option, in a way that the higher the volatility the higher the option price?",neutral,
298,"Interesting point, good use of references",pos,

315,"And for this calculation, the correlation between the assets also need to be considered",neutral,
316,"These are two different things: not being correlated does not mean that two assets are negatively correlated Yours is an example of the former, however not of the later (which in turn is the way of making the most out of diversification)",neutral,
317,What's being plotted in the efficient frontier is the maximum expected return for varying levels of risk of a portfolio The weightings themselves are not displayed in the efficient frontier,neg,
318,"Nice and clear explanation of ""dominated"" portfolios (ie, the ones that investor can improve upon)",pos,
319,"The axes of the graph need to be properly labeled Moreover, the efficient frontier and the CAL seem to coincide beyond some level of portfolio risk This would be wrong since there can be only one point of tangency between the efficient frontier and the CAL",neg,

324,Be mindful of page breaks,neutral,
325,"Good choice of example to illustrate the concept, well done",pos,
326,"Excellent discussion The use of futures for hedging purposes also eliminate the risk, though: sometimes we tend to see an adverse move in prices as detrimental to our position, but nonetheless there's always a hedging cost to be faced (as in the example above where the farmer locked in a price of $ but the spot price turned out to be $ in the expiry date)",pos,

342,"Good discussion and use of references - at times, the Black-Scholes model is used not to price options but rather to infer the volatility of the underlying asset For instance, the implied volatility is the one that makes the theoretical price of the option to be equal to the option price observed in the market",neutral,
343,"The constant volatility assumption is the one most likely violated in real markets, good job in mentioning it",pos,

345,"Excellent explanation of basis risk supported by a clear example, well done",pos,
346,Be mindful of page breaks,neutral,
347,"Yes, correct The type of preferences that we looked at the assignment and is mostly assumed in investment management theory is such that investor care about both risk and return As such, evaluating performance based only on observed returns would be misleading",neutral,

349,Very good exposition of an issue of the Sharpe ratio as a performance measure,pos,
350,An executive summary is missing,neg,
351,"It's not that the geometric mean takes into account the volatility in asset returns whereas the arithmetic mean does not, it's just that - by virtue of its formula - the geometric mean assigns less weight to extreme observations and, as such, is less affected by what could be viewed as outliers",neg,
352,"Good discussion provided, a reference here would fit well",pos,
353,"The efficient frontier is correct and the graph presented is properly labeled You could have titled the figure and added a proper caption to it (eg, Figure :)",neutral,

358,It would be better to provide clear section titles whenever addressing different questions of the assignment,neutral,
359,"The discussion provided in the final section was very instructive: you managed to articulate well what each measure of performance captures, and the corresponding limitations Following it, you should have concluded the report before presenting the references - recall that this document was meant to be a formal business report",neutral,

361,"Yes, and this is why it's not an easy task",pos,
362,Too repetitive,neg,
363,Good motivation for the discussion of arithmetic and the geometric means that follow The main features of each method (time vs dollar weighting) were well explained,pos,
364,Precisely what the standard deviation is: dispersion around the mean,neutral,
365,This happens when extreme events are observed - the Normal distribution does not assign high enough probability to them (the tails of the distribution are not fat enough),neutral,
366,"You could have presented in the body of the report the graph containing the efficient frontier, CAL and the optimal risky portfolio - that helps immensely the reader in understanding the theory",neutral,

382,"In which sense? This is not necessarily true, you could have explained this point better",neutral,
383,These type of discussion is too descriptive - it's better to provide a table and let the reader realize by herself how the numbers compare to each other,neutral,
